          Hey all you interweb viewers! I'm so sorry you ended up here, but since you are here...You're trapped forever!! Naw, I'm just kidding but I appreciate you coming here. So a quick "what to
          expect", you'll find my resume, a list of my top 20 fictional women, and a page to learn a little bit more about myself.
