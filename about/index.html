  <h2 class="gaming"> Gaming </h2>
    <p>
      Gaming has been something I have been doing since I was a wee little kid. The earliest game I can remember playing is pokemon red and blue version. Those games really got me into gaming, and my
      grandpa really helped influence that since he actually understood those games and helped me when I got in a pickle. Below I am going to list off all my favorite games as of right now, most likely the
      games I play right now because it is what I remember the easiest.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pokemon Silver/Gold</li>
      <li>Overwatch</li>
      <li>League of Legends</li>
      <li>Fallout 4</li>
      <li>Fallout 3</li>
      <li>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</li>
      <li>Elder Scrolls V: Skrim</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="past"> In the Past</h2>
    <p>
      So before going through pretty bad depression, I used be a little more creative...at least in my opinion. Back then I actually used to write poetry, short stories, and draw. Though, my short stories
      were really bad, I'm sure my poetry wasnt that great, and my drawing was just redrawing something that had already been drawn...nothing original. I sort of wish that I never gave up on that stuff
      because I could've kept practiticing and maybe be good at one of those things, which was an outlet for how I feel about stuff which I no longer have. I also have no poetry, stories, or drawings to
      share with you guys. Just thought I would share a bit about myself with you.

  <h2 class="ideaology">My Ideals</h2>
    <p>
      So in this section I thought I would give a brief summary on my take of the whole world. Yes you heard it here, the WHOLE WOLRD. Okay but really this won't be very long or complicated. I consider
      myself to be very analytical so I try to dissect other peoples thoughts. My main focus is to just let people be who they want. Although that's way too ideal, trust me it is. I do try my best to
      stand by that ideal though, no matter how wrong it may be. This stance on life makes me very very neutral to almost everything. Well when something I'm passionate about comes up I may not be able to
      keep my composure and my ideals might go out that window, but I think that normal human emotion. That's just about it though. I will except you for whatever you are, I could care less honestly. If I
      have the right to live and be what I want to be, well then everyone should. But you won't see me fighting for any of that because I don't care enough. I accept you all, but I have my own problems
      that I can't fix. So, yea. Hope you all have a great and lovely day.
