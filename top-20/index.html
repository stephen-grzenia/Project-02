              There isn't a lot to say about the craziest **** from summoners rift. She loves to cause chaos and mayhem within the town of piltover, using her guns Fishbones the rocket launcher and
              PowPow the minigun. And that's it! Breaking things just to break it is her motto. Some scientists say craziness is directly connected to attractiveness. The higher the crazy, the more
              attractive you are. And we can get much crazier then my beloved psycho, Jinx. She only has a cool music video. You can check out the song below.

              The spunky time manipulator with a gorilla(NOT HARAMBE) for a best friend.
              Tracer was an Ace pilot for a program called Overwatch, after an accident in a experimental teleporting aircraft, tracer became permanently displaced from time itself.
              That is until winston, the not Harambe gorilla, made a device to keep her in the current stream of time. This device also allowed her to manipulate the time around her, but only for
              herself. She's spunky, has freckles and the accent had me head over heels. She is also fun to play as in the game, but it's not why I love her so much.

              At least point I've had it up to here with this list. Note: I am not writing this list in order. I'm just not in the right mind set right now and don't care about what the content says. So
              basically why I like Hinoka is because she is really cute and a redhead. I love redheads. I actually hate using her in game. So in this case, i solely like her on her charactertics.

              Once the second mate to the notorious priate lord Crocodile, Robin is now a member of the Strawhat Pirates. Imbued with the power of a devil fruit, Robin has the ablilty to create...okay
              this is actually really hard to explain. She can create more of her limbs...anywhere she wants. The wall next to her? Yup, she can spawn a arm out of that wall. She can even do that on
              someone else's body, which allows her to subdue her enemies with ease. I just like her because I think she is hot. Also, her power can be used more for than just subduing enemies, but I'll
              leave that up to your imagination.

              Kushina is the fiery redhead of the naruto universe. Mother to the main character, Naruto, Kushina died, along with her husband, at Naruto's birth. She gave her life binding the nine-tailed
              fox demon into naruto's body to save the village that they lived in. Yes, that is weird sounding if you havn't seen the show or anime in general, but that's all I will say! Kushina is in my
              top twenty because she is a redhead and I really like her voice acting. Thats it. NEXT!

            <p>
              Ciri is a badass. But to explain her story I feel like I have to go back and research abunch of stuff. So, I will not be doing that. She was trained as a wolf under the legendary witcher
              Geralt. Though, ciri is not a witcher herself. She is a human who possesses the power of the emporer, which I don't fully understand. I know in game it makes her zip around like the flash
              and it's super overpowered. She is on this list for being a badass and cute as hell.

              WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Here we go spoilers central! I actually won't go into my queen too much because I refuse to spoil Game of Thrones. All you need to know is that she is
              Mother of Dragons. Yes. Dragons. Three dragons infact. That's all I have to say, and she is already a badass. I mostly like her because she has dragons. Dragons are sick. I mean she is
              hot, but dragons are hotter. Get it.....hotter....cause they breathe fire. HA.

              Touka is a ghoul. Okay so in the Toyko Ghoul universe, there are these beings called ghouls that survive by eating humans....and well....coffee. So....hmmm, talking about Touka and why I
              love her is getting into spoilers which I don't want to do because I love this show and want everyone in the world to love it too. She's just misunderstood, wanting to fit in, cute as hell,
              and deadly to a Tee.

              NORA! Another crazy redhead! Coming from the RWBY universe, she is a member of team JNPR...She is the N in JNPR. This tiny package packs quite a whallop, especially since she wield a giant
              hammer that also turns into a gernade launcher! Again another woman made it to this list because of her redhead hair, she's also pretty spunky and a little bit crazy, which is hot!

              Okay so I can't give a summary on this woman, because I never actually seen the whole show. I saw the first episode and was bored as hell, BUT Hotaru was really hot. That's all that matter.
              Literally the only reason why she is on this list is cause I think she's really cute.

              Vi is the fist of Piltover. Actually, I made that up. BUT it is fitting because she punches ****! When she faces a problem, she punches it with her giant hextech guantlets and if that
              doesnt solve it...punch it some more! Vi....stands for violence. Get it, because it have VI in the word VIOLENCE. IT'S FUNNY. Anyway, Vi makes it to my top twenty because I love her
              haircut, and she is just really really hot. Actually, many women are on this list because I think they're hot. But it's my list and I do what I want.

              Okay, im going to reiterate....this is MY list. I feel like I'm going to have to defend this pick much more then the others. Why you ask? Well...Tsu is a frog girl. In the My Hero Acedemia
              universe many poeple have these things called quirks. Theyre basically superpowers but they can range from basically being superman to making sticky bubbles from your hair. Tsu's quirk is
              having frog like attributes, from a long tongue, incredible swimming ablities, and being able to hop hop hop like a little froggie. She's still really cute for being part frog okay! And
              again I'm going to let your imagination take over for why I might like her because I dont want to make this site NSFW. Oh yea, she says ribbit. That's cute. NEXT!

              old. NEVER! Syndra is in the search for ultimate power. Yep, her goal in life is to gain more power....so she can throw more of her big balls at people. Twice and still not old. ZING. But

              OH HEY. We finally reached a pick that isn't just picked because she's hot! Bravo to me. I mean don't get me wrong she is cute, but in a adorbale yordle kind of way. By the way, a yordle is
              the species she is. Bascially she is a small person. That's it. At least in it's simpliest terms. She is on this list because I LOVE, LOVE playing her in game. She is by far one of my
              favorite characters to play in League of Legends. Plus one of her skins makes her own a baby dragon. So....you already know how I feel about dragons...which means tristana gets bonus points!

              LAST BUT NOT LEAST. Okay first off, if you don't know what RWBY is, I say you should watch it. Support rooster teeth with this amazing show they produced. Ruby is the leader of RWBY, and is
              the youngest on the team. She wields a giant scythe that turns into a sniper rifle which she uses in combat to fight the GRIMM. She is adorable, energetic, and will never give up. Also, SHE

              Man, talk about bringing up old memories. I don't even remember the last time I played Borderlands 2. Gaige is the Mechromancer. Like a necromancer except she summons a death dealing robot,
              instead of the undead. She is a absolute blast to play as, and watching Deathtrap, you know....that death dealing robot I mentioned earlier?, rip apart foe after foe while you just watch is
              fun as hell. Yes I am one of those kind of players, but at least I wasnt axton hiding behind a turret. That's right, shade has been thrown. I just love how quirky and crazy she is. And HEY,
              what do you know....she is a redhead. Surprise surprise.

              I actually forgot much of Lyn's background, and I'm really lazy so i don't want to look it up. I know she grew up in a small tribe, but she was destined for greatness. She was chosen by the
              Mani Katti, an ancient sword...which in this game can break because blades back then were made like trash apparently. Anyway, I just think she is really hot. She's hot and an amazing
              swordsman. So that's cool, which tentatively gets her the number three spot.

              I actually don't know why I am doing this. Sigh, this page...is something else. I couldn't think of anything else to do, but it's come down to this. Well we went over the frog girl, so lets
              go over the fox girl! I pray noone actually reads this list. I doubt anyone will but I'm not sure why im being honest with this list. Anyway! Fox girl, or Kitsune, is a girl with fox ears
              and tail. While holding a certain stone she can turn into a nine-tailed fox which she can use her agility and strength to take down her foes. Outside of her fox form, she is very playful
              and energic. She is also very oblivios to normal human behavior. I like her for her energy and playfulness, and she is also very cute.

              THE NUMBER 1 PICK. ALREADY??? Yes folks, this is it. Well to be honest, the spots change frequently. So, by this time next month Azura most likely won't be number one. Anyway! Azura,
              sigh.....here we go again. Spoilers....spoilers everywhere! Like I honestly can't bring something up without raising another question which leads to spoilers. Just play the game! Buy a 3DS,
              buy Fire Emblem Fates, and buy ALL the DLC....... Nintendo give me free stuff. At least story wise I can't talk about her much. Gameplay wise, Azura plays as the dancer class. Dancers have
              the ability to buff their allies, by well dancing. She is very cute, smart, caring, and very reserved. She just gives off that shy cuteness. Also she is a grade A dancer. It's just great.
